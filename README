To compile the program run 'make'  
To clean compilation objects run 'make clean'  
To run the program 
./mt-collatz <N> <num_threads> [-nolock]

The biggest hurdle we had in completing this project was not realizing that one worker thread  
continuously got stuck trying to process 0 at the beginning of the subroutine.
